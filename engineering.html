              As consumers, we rarely think about the hardware. More thought is placed on the software and apps that we use on a daily basis. But what about the chips, processors, screens, memory devices, and countless other physical technologies that make the software possible? By designing, testing, and analyzing new hardware, computer hardware engineers are the people who make it all possible.
